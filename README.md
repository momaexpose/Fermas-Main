# Fermas

**Fermas** is a small game about growing illegal plants on a boat to pay off a debt to a gangster.  
The entire game takes place on a single ship, where the player must manage limited space, time, and resources.

You grow plants in pots, harvest them into products, and sell them to pirates who visit the boat.  
What pirates buy depends on the current location, so planning and randomness are key.
